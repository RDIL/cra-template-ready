# cra-template-ready

Ready-to-use Create React App template, so you can ignore the useless files and get right to coding.

## How to Use

Use the `--template` argument with Create React App, which would end up looking like this:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app myprojectname --template ready
```

You don't even need to install the package from npm, as CRA will handle it all for you.
